## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-23

### Initial Public Release - Phase 1 Complete

This release marks the completion of **Milestone 1: Docker Compose Foundation** - a production-grade observability stack built on simulated on-premises infrastructure.

### Added

**Infrastructure & Virtualization:**
- KVM/QEMU/libvirt virtualization layer on Debian 13
- Virtual machine provisioning and lifecycle management
- Virtual networking with libvirt bridges and NAT
- Storage pools with qcow2 disk images

**Application Stack:**
- Flask backend (Python 3.11) with full OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- Vanilla HTML/JavaScript frontend served by Nginx
- SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- RESTful API with CRUD operations for task management
- Nginx reverse proxy with dynamic DNS resolution
- Browser-side OpenTelemetry instrumentation

**Observability Platform:**
- OpenTelemetry Collector (contrib 0.96.0) as telemetry hub
- Grafana Tempo 2.3.1 for distributed trace storage
- Prometheus 2.48.1 for metrics collection and querying
- Grafana Loki 2.9.3 for log aggregation
- Grafana 10.2.3 for unified visualization
- Pre-built SLI/SLO dashboards
- Pre-built End-to-End Tracing dashboard
- Complete trace-log correlation with trace_id/span_id injection

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Jenkins-based deployment automation
- Six-stage pipeline (sanity → context → sync → deploy → smoke tests)
- SSH key-based authentication (ED25519)
- Remote deployment via SSH + rsync
- Automated health checks and smoke testing
- Docker BuildKit optimization

**Instrumentation:**
- Three Pillars implementation (Traces, Metrics, Logs)
- Hybrid metrics strategy (Prometheus Client + OTel SDK)
- Automatic Flask HTTP instrumentation
- Automatic SQLAlchemy database instrumentation
- Structured JSON logging with python-json-logger
- Browser→Backend→Database end-to-end tracing
- W3C Trace Context propagation

**Documentation:**
- 150,000+ words of comprehensive technical documentation
- Modularized architecture documentation (8 sections)
- 16 design decisions fully documented with rationale
- Complete journey documentation with lessons learned
- Implementation guide with integration patterns
- Verification guide with deployment procedures
- Configuration reference for all components
- Troubleshooting playbooks for common issues
- Cross-cutting reference guides (TraceQL, PromQL, LogQL)

**Security:**
- SSH key-only authentication (password auth disabled)
- Production-grade security baseline
- CORS configuration with defense-in-depth approach
- Secure secrets handling patterns

### Technical Specifications

- **Infrastructure:** KVM/QEMU, libvirt, Debian 13
- **Application:** Flask 3.0.0, Python 3.11, Nginx Alpine, SQLite
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry 1.22.0, Tempo 2.3.1, Prometheus 2.48.1, Loki 2.9.3, Grafana 10.2.3
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins LTS, Docker 20.10+, Docker Compose 2.0+
- **Deployment:** SSH + rsync, automated health checks, smoke testing

### Known Limitations

- SQLite database (PostgreSQL migration planned for Phase 3)
- Single-node deployment (Kubernetes migration planned for Phase 3)
- Manual secrets management (Vault reintegration planned for Phase 2)
